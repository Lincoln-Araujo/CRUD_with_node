# My Tasks

A CRUD system inspired by a to-do list that counts with a dating system and clock.

##  Difficulties

By far the hardest project I've done so far. 

The hardest part was implementing the system to make the edit and annotation screens appear. I was able to manipulate the display properties of these respective components with javascript.

Clicking on the add button you activate a function that changes the display from 'none' to 'flex', causing the screen to add a new task to appear. As for editing, I used tags inside the ejs file to bring up the editing screen with the display set to flex, while in css, its initial value is none.
